				<h2>A quick note</h2>
				<p></p>
				Bellow are a few projects I have worked on over a lengthy amount of time. These are group projects
				that required a lot of commitment, communication, and the of learning new tools/abilities. Although small in size,
				I know the lessons learned from working on these projects will translate when working in the industry. 
				Each project has helped shape and grow my programming abilities. I still have much to learn
				but am focused and ready to learn more.<br>
				<br>
				Communication was absolutely an important skill/tool when trying to build an application together. 
				Some challenges included:<br>
				Learning to manage a repository together, Solving scheduling conflicts, being on the same page about the vision of the application,
				learning when to take lead and help those are struggling. 
				<br>The database project in particular posed an extra challenge when choosing a design for the 
				databsae schema. The design process has many angles and possibilites that coming to an agreement was difficult but the
				challenge was rewarding.

				<p>Currently, I am a Junior with 3 semesters leff. 
				My current goal is to find a summer internship (software developer) and gain 
				valuable work experience.</p>

				<h3>Shipping/Ordering Company Database and User application</h3>
				<b>About: </b>A database has been designed and implemented for a fictional company. This company is responsible
				for ordering inventory on behalf of clients who own vending machines and delivering said inventory to their machines.
				The database has been designed to ensure this job description can be successfully fulfilled and all data logged.<br><br>

				A user application is then created to interact with the data. I created a web application that allows the 
				dispatcher to create orders, view the history of orders, find a specific order, or create a few custom reports
				on the status of the company.<br>
				*The web application uses free online templates that are tweaked

				<br><br>For a much more detailed description please read the README.md on the projects repository.

				<br>A technical/educational book has been written documenting the design process of the database, it's implementation,
				and a breakdown of the web application and it's functions. Chapter 5 is about the application.<br>

				<br><b>My Role:</b><br>This project was very time consuming and I was heavily involved with all parts. I played a leadership role 
				and guided my team through the processes. As a team, we built a schema that we felt proud of and implemented the database in parts.<br>
				I wrote queries, procedures and triggers for team, created all tables with the appropriate constraints/keys, generated all random data,
				and tested/ensured the database functioned properly.<br>
				I felt an obligation to help my team and did so by reviewing code, making quick fixes, and ensuring the team was heading in the right direction.<br>
				I also implemented the web application for the Dispatcher employee.

				<h3>CSUB Battle Royale</h3>
				<p><b>About:</b> This is a game inspired by battle royale games. 
				<br>A character is spawned in the middle of the map and must take out a group of AI enemies. 
				<br>The player can collect different guns and must fight a boss at the end.
				It was built as a school-group project in collaboration with other students.</p>

				<h3>Language Ladders</h3>
				<p><b>About:</b> An android app that helps users learn and study a new language. 
				A user can study and take a quiz on the material. 
				<br>The current supported languages are English/Japanese.</p>

				<p><b>Technologies/Languages:</b> Java, Android Studio, SQLite/ROOM
				<p><b>Credits:</b> Edwin Gonzalez, Joel Staggs
				<p><b>My Role:</b> This app has been very free flow. Joel and I add features as we think of them.
				<br>My biggest contribution has been implementing a database. However, everything gets 
				tweaked by both Joel and I after implementation.</p>
