                <h2>Languages/Technologies</h2>
                <b>Java: </b>Proficient. Comfortable using java to implement fundamental concepts such as 
                data structures, simple socket connections, and using Object-Oriented programming.<br>

                <br><b>C/C++: </b>Intermediate. Comfortable using C/C++ to do the same as java but not at the same speed
                and at the same leve. Comfortable with pointers.<br>
                
                <br><b>HTML/CSS: </b>Intermediate/Novice. Can build web pages using HTML at an intermediate level.
                <br>Can apply basics of CSS but do not have a deep designer bakground.<br>

                <br><b>JavaScript: </b>Novice. Can apply the basics but I know my programming fundamentals can translate to better learning 
                this language if needed.<br>

                <br><b>PHP: </b>Novice. Can use PHP to connect to a database and populate web pages with data. Can build simple structures 
                like a shopping cart, use session variables, and query data as needed. 
                <br>I plan to study and use PHP more over the year to get a much better understanding of the language.<br>

                <br><b>SQL: </b>Novice/Intermediate. Can write non-trivial, challenging queries using relational algebra as a basis.<br>
                <br><b>PostgreSQL: </b>Can implement a relational model schema, write procedures, triggers, work with views, and 
                map constraints on relations (tables).<br>

				<h3>Shipping/Ordering Company Database and User application</h3>
				<b>About: </b>A database has been designed and implemented for a fictional company. This company is responsible
				for ordering inventory on behalf of clients who own vending machines and delivering said inventory to their machines.
				The database has been designed to ensure this job description can be successfully fulfilled and all data logged.<br><br>

				A user application is then created to interact with the data. I created a web application that allows the 
				dispatcher to create orders, view the history of orders, find a specific order, or create a few custom reports
				on the status of the company.<br>
				*The web application uses free online templates that are tweaked

				<br><br>For a much more detailed description please read the README.md on the projects repository.

				<br>A technical/educational book has been written documenting the design process of the database, it's implementation,
				and a breakdown of the web application and it's functions. Chapter 5 is about the application.<br>

				<br><b>My Role:</b><br>This project was very time consuming and I was heavily involved with all parts. I played a leadership role 
				and guided my team through the processes. As a team, we built a schema that we felt proud of and implemented the database in parts.<br>
				I wrote queries, procedures and triggers for team, created all tables with the appropriate constraints/keys, generated all random data,
				and tested/ensured the database functioned properly.<br>
				I felt an obligation to help my team and did so by reviewing code, making quick fixes, and ensuring the team was heading in the right direction.<br>
				I also implemented the web application for the Dispatcher employee.

				<p><b>Technologies/Languages:</b> Java, Android Studio, SQLite/ROOM
				<p><b>Credits:</b> Edwin Gonzalez, Joel Staggs
				<p><b>My Role:</b> This app has been very free flow. Joel and I add features as we think of them.
				<br>My biggest contribution has been implementing a database. However, everything gets 
				tweaked by both Joel and I after implementation.</p>
